Questions for framework:


- parameters described 
	- finish Arya, decomposition 

- sample mine?
	- is edge perforation done?

- when is decoupling worth it?

-how would an API be supported?
 - generateSample

- sampling width?

- programming detail of generateSample combined with exact count.
	- generate samples?

- make a table to compare...
	
- decoupling or not generateSample/ExactCount is combined.

- api for sampling algorithm.

- probability that G' included a specific pattern.

- overlap factor for sample mine??

-ASAP only include common edge.
	- only include neighbors of one of the vertices for closing edges also works.



- how to define 


- full variance calculation


- tradeoff-

- sampling width downside from overlap work -- n smaller 


- not convinced -- Arya

Theoretically-- when is ASAP better...
	- variance limitation
